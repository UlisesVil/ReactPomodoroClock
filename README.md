#  React Pomodoro Clock

A fully responsive countdown application, built with React, can help the user scheduling study sessions or any other activity they need to focus on or dedicate a specific time.

The user can adjust the session time between 1 and 60 minutes. When the first session ends, it will automatically start again with the time adjustment of the break length.

Break length has values between 1 and 60 min.

The count will not stop until the user decides to stop it by pressing the start button.

The clock will start the countdown. If it reaches zero, the alarm will be activated.

The user can pause his session and can also restore the initial values.

The time indicator will turn white when active and red when it reaches 1 minute.
